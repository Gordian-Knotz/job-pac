-- 007 — CV storage bucket
-- ============================================================
-- NOT YET APPLIED — run this one yourself.
--
-- No storage bucket exists on this project. Two consequences:
--   * components/apply-form.tsx has no file input at all, so the public apply
--     form collects name/email/phone/cover letter and no CV.
--   * applications.cv_url for all 4,355 migrated rows holds an absolute URL on
--     the dead WordPress host (https://jobs.pac.africa/wp-content/uploads/
--     jobmonster/...). Those files were never re-hosted and will 404.
--
-- PATH CONVENTION (the app depends on this):
--   New uploads go to bucket `cvs`, object name `<uuid>/<filename>.pdf`.
--   applications.cv_url and profiles.cv_url store that OBJECT NAME, not a URL.
--   A cv_url beginning with 'http' is therefore a dead legacy link, and the UI
--   renders it disabled. Anything else is a storage path resolved through
--   createSignedUrl. See lib/supabase/storage.ts.
--
-- WHY ANON MAY INSERT: guests apply. That is the primary audience, and the old
-- site's data shows _candidate_user_id was 0 for nearly every one of the 4,355
-- historical applications. Abuse is bounded at the bucket level rather than by
-- policy: PDF-only and 5 MB are enforced by storage itself, so a malicious
-- uploader cannot use this as general-purpose file hosting.
--
-- Anon gets INSERT and nothing else -- no select, no list, no update, no delete.

-- ── READ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The uploader. Supabase Storage stamps `owner` from the JWT, so this covers a
-- seeker re-reading the CV on their own profile. Guest uploads have owner NULL
-- and are unreachable by this branch, which is intended.

-- The employer, for CVs attached to applications on jobs they own -- matched on
-- the object name recorded in applications.cv_url. This is what lets an
-- employer open a guest applicant's CV without the bucket being public.
