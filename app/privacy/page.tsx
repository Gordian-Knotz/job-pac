/**
 * Data and cookies policy.
 *
 * NOT LEGAL ADVICE — this is an accurate description of what the system does,
 * written so a lawyer has something factual to review rather than a template to
 * rewrite. Two things in here are decisions only PAC can make and are marked in
 * the page itself: the retention period, and ODPC registration.
 *
 * Every factual claim below was checked against the running system:
 *   - Supabase project region is eu-west-1 (Ireland), so this is a cross-border
 *     transfer out of Kenya and says so.
 *   - An anonymous request to this site sets no cookies at all. Only the
 *     Supabase session cookie appears, after sign-in.
 *   - Vercel Web Analytics is cookieless, and components/web-analytics.tsx
 *     drops admin/dashboard paths and strips query strings before sending.
 *
 * The prose lives here rather than in lib/content.ts on purpose: content.ts is
 * for interface strings that get reused and localised, not for a legal document
 * that is read top to bottom in one place.

        <Section title="What we collect">
          <p>When you apply for a role, we collect what you give us:</p>
          <List
            items={[
              "Your name, email address and phone number",
              "Your CV, if you attach one",
              "Your cover letter, if you write one",
              "The role you applied for and when",
            ]}
          />
          <p>
            If you create an account, we also store what you choose to add to
            your profile — a headline, a short bio, skills, your county or town, a
            LinkedIn link, and a CV kept on file so you do not have to attach it
            each time. Roles you save are stored against your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not ask for, and do not want, your national ID number, date of
            birth, marital status, religion, ethnicity, health information or a
            photograph. If your CV happens to contain any of that, it is in the
            file you sent us and we do not extract or index it.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Applications made before this site">
          <p>
            PAC Africa ran an earlier version of this job board. Applications
            made through it were carried across, so we may already hold an
            application you submitted before you ever visited this site,
            including the CV attached to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you create an account with the same email address you applied
            with, you can claim those records and see your own history. Nobody
            else can see them, and claiming requires you to confirm your email
            address first — which is precisely so that somebody who merely knows
            your address cannot claim your history.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Who can see it">
          <List
            items={[
              "PAC Africa staff, who review applications as part of placing candidates.",
              "The employer for the specific role you applied to — your name, contact details, cover letter and CV. They cannot see applications you made to other roles.",
              "Nobody else. Your CV is never public, is never listed in a search engine, and is only ever reachable through a private link that expires after five minutes.",
            ]}
          />
          <p>
            Employers do not see applications to other employers' roles, and
            other applicants never see yours. Access is enforced by the database
            itself rather than by the interface, so it holds even if somebody
            queries our API directly.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Where it is stored">
          <p>
            We use three providers. Two of them mean your data leaves Kenya, and
            you should know that:
          </p>
          <List
            items={[
              "Supabase — the database holding your application and profile. Hosted in Ireland (eu-west-1).",
              "Cloudflare R2 — where CV files are stored. Private, and only reachable through a short-lived signed link.",
              "Vercel — serves the website itself.",
            ]}
          />
          <p>
            Because the database is in Ireland, your personal data is transferred
            outside Kenya. Under the Data Protection Act 2019 you are entitled to
            know that, which is why it is stated plainly here rather than buried.
            Ireland is subject to the EU GDPR, which sets a standard of protection
            comparable to Kenya's.

        <Section title="Cookies">
          <p>
            <strong className="text-ink">

            Browsing this site anonymously sets no cookies at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you sign in, we set one session cookie so you stay signed in
            between pages. It is strictly necessary — without it, signing in would
            not work — and it holds no advertising identifier. Your theme
            preference is kept in your own browser's local storage and never
            reaches us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We measure page views with Vercel Web Analytics, which is cookieless
            and does not build a profile of you. We deliberately strip the query
            string from every recorded URL and record nothing at all for staff
            pages, so a search typed into an internal screen never leaves the
            product.

        <Section title="How long we keep it">
          <p>
            Applications are kept so that employers can review them and so you
            can see your own history. Our records currently go back to 2023.

            and we will respond within 30 days. Deleting your account removes your

        <Section title="Security">
          <p>
            CVs are held in private storage and are never publicly addressable —
            each view generates a link that stops working after five minutes.
            Access to applications is enforced in the database, so a role you did
            not post is not readable by you even through our API. Passwords are
            handled by our authentication provider and are never visible to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            The earlier version of this site was compromised in August 2026. The
            application data was recovered intact and this rebuild exists in part
            to remove the weaknesses that allowed it. If we ever believe your data
            has been exposed, we will tell you.
