 * Every public URL, so a listing is found the day it publishes rather than
 * whenever a crawler happens across it.
 *
 * Only published jobs appear, and that is enforced by RLS rather than by the
 * filter below — `jobs_select_published` is what this query runs under, so a
 * draft cannot leak into the sitemap even if someone removes the `.eq()`.
 *
 * No employer names and no company URLs: the company behind a role is
 * admin-only, and a sitemap is the most public surface there is.
