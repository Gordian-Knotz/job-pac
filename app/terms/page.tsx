/**
 * Terms of Service.
 *
 * FIRST DRAFT, NOT LEGAL ADVICE — this describes what the system actually
 * does and enforces (moderation, suspension, account rules), written so a
 * lawyer has something factual to review and tighten rather than a blank
 * page to start from. It should be reviewed by PAC/legal before being
 * treated as binding. See app/privacy/page.tsx for the same convention —
 * that page similarly marks its own open decisions rather than guessing.
 *
 * Every behavioural claim below matches what the database actually enforces,
 * not just what the UI suggests:
 *   - listings only reach the public site after an admin publishes them
 *     (migrations 012, 019, 021 — guard_job_status());
 *   - a suspended account cannot apply or post, enforced by trigger rather
 *     than only in the interface (migration 022);
 *   - account role/email cannot be self-changed (migration 025).

            The site is provided as-is. We do not warrant that listings are

            service will be uninterrupted or error-free. To the extent
            permitted by Kenyan law, {site.owner} is not liable for losses
            arising from your use of the site, including a hiring decision
            made or not made as a result of it.

        <Section title="Changes">
          <p>
            We may update these terms as the product changes. If we make a
            material change, we will update the date above; continued use
            after that means you accept the revised terms.

        <Section title="Governing law">
          <p>
            These terms are governed by the laws of Kenya. Disputes arising
            from your use of the site are subject to the jurisdiction of the
            Kenyan courts.
