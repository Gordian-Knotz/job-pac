/**
 * Saved roles (brief §8) — the same clay cards as the public browse page, which
 * is the point: a saved role should look identical to how it looked when it was
 * saved.
 *
 * A saved job whose listing has since closed is filtered out by RLS rather than
 * by this query: `jobs_select_published` only exposes published rows, so the
 * embedded join comes back null and the row is dropped below. The saved_jobs row
 * survives, so if the employer reopens the role it reappears here.
