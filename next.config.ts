/**
 * Security headers, addressing the PageSpeed "Trust and Safety" audits.
 *
 * Vercel already sent Strict-Transport-Security and nothing else. These are the
 * static headers; the Content-Security-Policy is set per-request in
 * middleware.ts because it carries a nonce.
 *
 * NOT SET, deliberately:
 *
 *   require-trusted-types-for 'script'
 *     Would break the product. components/job-detail.tsx renders job copy with
 *     dangerouslySetInnerHTML, and Trusted Types blocks exactly that unless
 *     every sink goes through a registered policy. The XSS risk it targets is
 *     already handled at the point that matters — lib/sanitize.ts runs an
 *     allowlist over that HTML on every render, verified against 11 payloads.
 *     Adding Trusted Types means routing the sanitiser output through a
 *     TrustedHTML policy first; worth doing deliberately, not as a header flip.
 *
 *   Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy
 *     Only needed for SharedArrayBuffer / high-resolution timers, neither of
 *     which this app uses, and it breaks any cross-origin subresource that does
 *     not opt in with CORP. Cost with no benefit here.
