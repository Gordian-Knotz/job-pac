/**
 * The service-role client. It bypasses row-level security completely.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  READ THIS BEFORE ADDING A SECOND CALLER.
 *
 *  Every other query in this codebase runs as the person making the request, so
 *  RLS is what keeps one user's data away from another. Anything that goes
 *  through here has no such protection: a missing `.eq()` is a full-table read
 *  and a wrong id is someone else's record.
 *
 *  It exists for exactly one job: writing a GUEST job application. A guest has
 *  no session, so there is no `auth.uid()` for a policy to check against, and
 *  migration 024 removed anonymous INSERT rather than leaving an open write
 *  endpoint on the applications table. The ownership check therefore has to move
 *  into code — and the code is deliberately narrow:
 *
 *    - it writes through `submit_guest_application()`, which fixes the column
 *      list, forces `applicant_id` to null and re-checks that the job is
 *      published, so a bug here cannot become an arbitrary insert;
 *    - it uploads one PDF to one bucket, at a path this process generates.
 *
 *  If you need elevated access for something else, prefer a `security definer`
 *  function scoped to that task and granted to `service_role`, so the privilege
 *  is bounded by SQL rather than by whoever is editing the TypeScript.
